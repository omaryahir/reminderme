task
----

This project connect with your Reminders App. With that so you can see your task in the terminal you have to change add chmod +x to task-list.sh and for task.sh to use it:

	$ ./task-list.sh 

or 

	$ ./task.sh 

The last option call a "Home" list you can customize in this file editing with a text editor

I hope this will help you.
