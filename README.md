task
----

This project connect with your Reminders App. With that so you can see your reminders in the terminal.

For installation download taskcmd.sh and task.sh and in terminal apply:

	$ chmod +x task.sh
	$ chmod +x taskcmd.sh

After that you can use:

	$ ./taskcmd.sh 

or ...

	$ ./task.sh 

The last option will call to "Home" list, you can customize this, in the file editing with a text editor.

You can edit ~/.bash_profile or make a link to use it in any folder in terminal.


I hope this will help you.
